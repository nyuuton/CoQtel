# Quantum Telecloning N1 -> M1000

Performs a variant of (approximate) quantum cloning, known as quantum telecloning, copying a single qubit to 1000 approximate clones. Uses mid-circuit measurement and classical feedforward control instructions. 

- `qubit_indices_Quantum_Telecloning_N1_M1000_LNN.json` is a python-dictionary, saved as a JSON file, which contains what the qubit indices are, specifically what the message qubit is that is cloned, what the port qubit is, what the M-1 ancilla qubits are, and what the M clone qubits are. 
- Note that the clone qubits states are not measured in these circuits. In principle, if you want to characterize the clone quality, you could perform single qubit state tomography on all of the clone qubits.
- For these circuits, the pure quantum state that is cloned is parameterized by a $Ry_{pi/2}$ gate followed by a $Rz_{pi/2}$ gate. This angle could be changed and the clone quality would be unaffected because the cloning circuit is universal and symmetric.
- These circuits were exported as OpenQASM3 strings
- Compiled and optimized for an all-to-all connectivity graph
- The qasm3 file is very large, so it is compressed to save space
